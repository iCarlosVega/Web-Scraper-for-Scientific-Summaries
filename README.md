# Web-Scraper-for-Scientific-Summaries

<p>This was a fun small project to really bridge my gap on trully understanding how API's work, it incorporates chatGPT 3.5-turbo for the summarizing.</p>
<p>Make sure if you want to give this project a shot that you use your own keys for chatGPT, as well as set the directory for the file_maker() function to an appropriate folder!</p>

<p>You might have to change the headers for your requests!</p>

<p>Enjoy it :)</p>
