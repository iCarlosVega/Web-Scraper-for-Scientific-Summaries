# Web-Scraper-for-Scientific-Summaries

This was a fun small project to really bridge my gap on trully understanding how API's work, it incorporates chatGPT 3.5-turbo for the summarizing.
Make sure if you want to give this project a shot that you use your own keys for chatGPT, as well as set the directory for the file_maker() function to an appropriate folder!

You might have to change the headers for your requests!

Enjoy it :)
